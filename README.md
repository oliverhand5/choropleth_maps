# choropleth_maps
Use R to create basic choropleth maps


This file requires a R installation, plus ideally RStudio as an editor.  The package leaflet is used to create the maps.
There is a loader for libaries in the file, these will need to be installed on the first run (see commented code).

The shape files are set to a specific ICS, thes could be changed to represent another area using ONS published files.
All shape files are from ONS published data, and are owned by the ONS.

All code is run at your own risk.
